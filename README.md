# Project_DA_Java_EN_Come_to_the_Rescue_of_a_Java_Application

This program needs the symptoms.txt file to read the symptoms. For my project I copied it to my local drive. To run the program,
the user will need to update the location of the file.
This program creates a file with symptoms and the number of occurrences. The output location of the file also needs to be uddated when 
running the program.
